# Unit VR Simple Interaction

This project is a simple application for Virtual Reality Apps made with Unity containing a scene with a player and a cube. The Cube responds to user gaze with a glowing behaviour. The idea is to use this simple project as a start point for more robust applications since it already contains all scripts, images and materials necessary to create a Player in a virtual reality environment with a reticle that shows where the user is looking at and scripts that allow objects to interact with the user.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is clone this repository and build the scene. There are no external dependencies.

## Prerequisites

You must have Unity 5.6.0 or above installed on your machine to be able to run this project.
